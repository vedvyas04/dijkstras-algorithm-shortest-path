<h2> Using dijkstras algorithm to find shortest path </h2>

<h3> As the name suggests, I've used dijkstras algorithm to find shortest path for the campus map at Northeastern university.</h3>

<p> The Northeastern map used in this repo can be downloaded from the 1st link at the end of this readme. For practical purposes, I've selected only 16 buildings + necessary intersections as the vertices.
However, the algorithm and code is universal. To use it for a different test case just change the data in the file</p>

<p> Format of the 1st file should be: the total number of vertices followed
by the data of the graph edges. For each edge, provide its "vertex_1 vertex_2 distance" </p>

<p> Format of the 2nd file should be: the number of buildings in your graph in the first line followed by "vertex_number building_code.
</p>

<p> Distances are measure by using google maps. Use the 2nd link as the reference on how to measure the exact distance. </p>
